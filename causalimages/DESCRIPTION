Description: Provides a system for performing causal inference with earth observation,
    bio-medical, and social science images and image sequences (videos). The package
    uses a 'JAX' backend for GPU/TPU acceleration. Key functionalities include building
    conda-based backends (e.g., via 'BuildBackend'), implementing image-based confounder
    and heterogeneity analyses (e.g., 'AnalyzeImageConfounding', 'AnalyzeImageHeterogeneity'),
    and writing/reading large image corpora as '.tfrecord' files for use in training 
    (via 'WriteTfRecord' and 'GetElementFromTfRecordAtIndices'). This allows researchers
    to scale causal inference to modern large-scale imagery data, bridging R with
    hardware-accelerated Python libraries. The package is partly based on Jerzak
    and Daoud (2023) <arXiv:2310.00233>.
