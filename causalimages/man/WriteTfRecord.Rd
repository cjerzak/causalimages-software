\title{Write an image corpus as a .tfrecord file}
\usage{
WriteTfRecord(
  file,
  uniqueImageKeys,
  acquireImageFxn,
  writeVideo = F,
  image_dtype = "float16",
  conda_env = "CausalImagesEnv",
  conda_env_required = T,
  Sys.setenv_text = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A character string naming a file for writing.}

\item{uniqueImageKeys}{A vector specifying the unique image keys of the corpus.
A key grabs an image/video array via \code{acquireImageFxn(key)}.}

\item{acquireImageFxn}{A function whose input is an observation index and whose output is an array with dimensions \verb{(nBatch, Spatial1, Spatial2, nChannels)} for images and  \verb{(nBatch, nTimeSteps, Spatial1, Spatial2, nChannels)} for image sequence data.}

\item{writeVideo}{(default = \code{FALSE}) Should we assume we're writing image sequence data of form batch by time by height by width by channels?}

\item{conda_env}{(default = \code{"CausalImagesEnv"}) A \code{conda} environment where computational environment lives, usually created via \code{causalimages::BuildBackend()}}

\item{conda_env_required}{(default = \code{T}) A Boolean stating whether use of the specified conda environment is required.}
}
\value{
Writes a unique key-referenced \code{.tfrecord} from an image/video corpus for use in image-based causal inference training.
}
\description{
Writes an image corpus to a \code{.tfrecord} file for rapid reading of images into memory for fast ML training.

# Example usage (not run):
